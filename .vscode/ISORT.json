Imagine this: You open a Django file, and the imports look like a crime scene. 🚔🚨


Total chaos.

No order.
No structure.
Just pain. 💀

If you haven’t fixed this yet, you’re making one of the biggest mistakes of your coding life. But don’t worry — I’m about to save you. 🚀

The Problem: Messy Imports = Messy Mind
A cluttered import section slows you down, causes confusion, and makes debugging harder. Every second you spend scrolling through messy imports is a second wasted. And trust me, time is money. 💸

Solution? Say hello to isort—the one tool every Django developer must use! 🎯

What is isort? 🎯
isort is a life-changing Python tool that:

Automatically sorts imports in a logical order.
Groups standard, third-party, and local imports neatly.
Removes duplicate imports (because why repeat yourself? 🤦‍♂️).
Works with black for ultimate code cleanliness.
1. Install isort (Do It NOW!)
You must install isort—there’s no excuse!

pip install isort
🚀 Boom. You’re officially leveling up.

2. Use isort in Django (This Will Blow Your Mind)
Fix Imports in One File
Before:

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import Customer
import sys
from rest_framework import serializers
from drf_queryfields import QueryFieldsMixin
from django.conf import settings
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView
import django
from django.db import connection
import os
Run:

isort myapp/views.py
After:

import os
import sys

import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import connection
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.shortcuts import render
from drf_queryfields import QueryFieldsMixin
from rest_framework import serializers
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView

from .models import Customer
LOOK AT THAT CLEANLINESS! ✨

Fix Imports Across Your Entire Django Project
isort .
Yes, one command cleans up every import across your whole Django project. Game-changer. 🎮💥

3. Customize isort (Be a Code God) 🚀
To make isort play perfectly with Django, add this .isort.cfg file:

[settings]
profile = django
known_django = django
sections = FUTURE,STDLIB,DJANGO,THIRDPARTY,FIRSTPARTY,LOCALFOLDER
line_length = 88
multi_line_output = 3
Now, Django imports are grouped separately, automatically! No more headaches. 😎

4. Automate it using pre-commit hooks:
create a new .pre-commit-config.yaml on root folder and paste the below code

repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: "6.0.0"
    hooks:
      - id: isort
Now, isort will clean imports automatically before every commit. EFFORTLESS. 💪

Why This is LIFE-CHANGING for Django Devs 🚀
If you ignore isort, you’re making your life harder for no reason.

No more messy imports.
No more scrolling through random order.
No more manual sorting.
Your teammates will respect you.
🚨 Bottom line: If you’re not using isort, you’re working harder, not smarter. Fix that today.

Conclusion: The Biggest Upgrade to Your Django Workflow 🎉
You’ve made one of the smartest choices by reading this blog. But knowing isn’t enough — you must take action.
